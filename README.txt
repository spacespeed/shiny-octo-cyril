The two *.class files in the resources directory are required for the launcher to work.
They are produced as the output from another project (Mineshafter launcher resources).
It should be on my Github profile along with this.
If an update occurs, or you need to make changes to them, take the two output files from the other project and
stick them in the resources directory here.
